# departures

First I just want to leave a note. I did read in the task that I should use css/scss/sass/less or css in js but due to time constraints I opted to use windicss. This isn't because I can't use css (I use it in my day to day work along with bootstrap) but I wanted to make sure that I was building this app quickly so I can focus on 1) functionality and 2) testing. I recently picked up windicss and really like it as it makes building UI components really fast. I hope this doesn't knock too many points since windicss is essentially just a different way to access the same css properties I would be using anyway, just without the overhead of adding a class markup. If time weren't an issue, I could employ a naming convention such as BEM (which I generally use at work) to make sure that the markup is semantic and maintainable.
